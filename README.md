It will be good to know that since in created bigapple
business has been up and down the hill.
I had my hands dirty in building wordpress sites.
Since then bigapple has changed its name. 
The new manager will not even want any idea of a virtual,
contact or payment/appointment system.
I am stuck with the dormain name which i have to pay for.
It has expire and i am not willing to pay anymore.
But i am grateful for all i did learn.
